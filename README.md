This tutorial is only for Lenovo legion Y730/Y740. Back up your important files before starting. All files, that you require for macOS installation, are available in my GitHub page. So, let’s begin…

# Intel® Virtualization Technology (Intel® VT)
Many application uses Intel Virtualization Technology, example like:
1. XAMPP
2. Android Studio
3. Virtual Machine/VMWare
4. etc..

So, I enabled Intel Virtual Technology from BIOS, and those apps are working now.
